INTRODUCTION
------------
Provides a Java JNI wrapper to the lowlevel FUSE interface for writing a FUSE
file system in Java. After compiling the package, this package produces 
a jar file called JFUSE.jar and the JNI native library, libjfuselib.{so,dylib}


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Recent Linux or Mac
Linux FUSE >= 2.6  (2.9 for splice interface)
Fuse4X (Mac os x)
Java >= 6 
Cmake >= 2.6


INSTALLATION
------------

set JAVA_HOME to the java installation directory if cmake can't find it with 
the FINDJava.cmake module

cd src
cmake .
make

Copy JFUSE/lowlevel/JFUSE.jar and  JFUSE/lowlevel/lib/libjfuselib.so to the 
dependencies directory for your filesystem implementation. Make sure that 
JFUSE.jar is included in the java classpath and the location of libjfuselib.so 
is given to java with -Djava.library.path=<path-to-library>.
